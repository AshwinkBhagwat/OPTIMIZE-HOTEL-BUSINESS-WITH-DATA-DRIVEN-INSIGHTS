OPTIMIZE HOTEL BUSINESS WITH DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS: Excel 


## Problem Statement
The hotel owner wants to analyze high cancellation rates, ADR, unpredictable booking patterns, and decreasing lead time to gain insights into customer behavior, optimize revenue, and improve the customer experience. This analysis will help the hotel owner make data-driven decisions and formulate effective strategies to enhance business growth.

## Insights
1.Average daily rate (ADR) for city hotel is 102.36 and for resort hotel is 97.45.

2.A 38% cancellation rate for the tourist destination hotel is considered high, indicating that more than one-third of the bookings made are being cancelled.

3.The hotel heavily relies on travel agents for bookings, accounting for 87% of total bookings, which may be concerning.

4.The average lead time of 105.5 days for the tourist hotel is favorable, but it is worrying to note that high lead times are associated with a higher cancellation rate.

These insights can be used to optimize revenue and improve customer experience. For example, the hotel can consider offering incentives to customers who book directly with them, reducing their dependence on travel agents. The hotel can also work on improving the cancellation policy to reduce the high cancellation rate and analyze the reasons behind cancellations. Finally, the hotel can work on reducing lead times to improve customer satisfaction and reduce the risk of cancellations.
